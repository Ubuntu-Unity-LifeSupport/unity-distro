# Agent A - running state

Test desktop: `target` (192.168.56.20, VM `target-desktop`, snapshot `Clean-updated-2026-09-23`)
Build directory: `~/work/a`

## Now (2026-10-12 14:25Z)

New session of A (2026-10-12), after the permission-model freeze was lifted.

In progress:
- **UNITY-20261009-001** (SECURITY, details private): unity-settings-daemon
  `+unity14`, IMPLEMENTING. Local package and meta branches
  `a/UNITY-20261009-001`, nothing pushed. Next: the gate build passes its
  tests, then target, Verifier, publication slot.

Queued for A after it:
- **UNITY-20261008-023** (INVESTIGATING): cinnamon-session presence idle in
  the Unity session (org.cinnamon.Muffin.IdleMonitor in u-s-d); May chose
  idle blank+lock with the delay from `org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay`.
- **UNITY-20260928-008** (BLOCKED, waits for May): research for his decision.

Finished since the last update (DONE): UNITY-20261002-012, UNITY-20260927-053,
UNITY-20261008-024; UNITY-20261002-013 closed as ALREADY_FIXED.

## State of `target`

2026-10-08 03:15Z: published stack from our repository, including u-s-d
+unity11 (the three debs taken from the repository with apt-get download,
equal to the published ones), with the two dbgsym packages of the tested
build; cinnamon-session 6.4.2-1+unity3; no `gnome.is_vm`; test scripts and
debs in `~`; `~/.dirty` present. vbox MCP unavailable (checks over ssh).
Earlier states below are history:

Restored again 2026-09-29 11:04Z (UNITY-20260927-040) from
`Clean-updated-2026-09-23` (fresh boot, no `~/.dirty`), our repository added,
`full-upgrade`; xdotool, x11-utils, xterm, python3-evdev installed. After the
tests: unity back to the published `+unity11`, workspaces 1x1 again, test
files removed, rebooted; the two 047 capture files stay in `~`. `~/.dirty`
present. The earlier restore of the same day (below) is superseded:

Restored 2026-09-29 07:55Z from `Clean-updated-2026-09-23` (confirmed from
the guest: fresh boot, no `~/.dirty`), then: our aptly added
(`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/unity-distro.list`, key
`/usr/share/keyrings/unity-distro.gpg`), `full-upgrade` to our stack;
xdotool, xauth, x11-utils installed. lightdm back to aptly `+unity1` after
the +unity2 tests; the test user `utest`, the pam_exec test hook and the test
scripts removed. `~/.dirty` present. Everything older in this file's history
(the pre-2026-09-29 target state) no longer applies - the snapshot restore
discarded it.
